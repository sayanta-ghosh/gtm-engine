"""Concurrent batch execution engine.

When you have 20 people to enrich or 50 companies to look up, this module
runs them in parallel against the SAME provider with:

- **Concurrency control**: Semaphore limits concurrent calls (default 5)
  to respect provider rate limits without overwhelming them.
- **Per-record error isolation**: One failed record doesn't kill the batch.
  Failures are captured and returned alongside successes.
- **Checkpointing**: Progress saved every N records. Large batches can
  report progress incrementally (e.g., "50/200 done, cost so far: $1.50").
- **Cost aggregation**: Tracks total cost, cache hits, and per-record costs.
- **Timeout protection**: Global timeout prevents runaway batches.

The execution pipeline for EACH record is still the full service.py pipeline:
    rate_limit → cache_check → resolve_key → retry(provider.execute) → normalize → cache_store

So every record benefits from caching (duplicates are free), rate limiting
(won't overwhelm upstream), and retry (transient failures auto-heal).

Usage:
    checkpoint = await execute_batch(
        db=db,
        operation="enrich_person",
        provider_name="apollo",
        records=[
            {"email": "jane@acme.com"},
            {"email": "john@acme.com"},
            ...  # 20 records
        ],
        tenant_id="tenant-xyz",
        concurrency=5,          # 5 concurrent calls
        checkpoint_every=10,    # progress update every 10 records
    )
    print(f"{checkpoint.completed}/{checkpoint.total} done, cost: {checkpoint.cost_so_far}")

    This is the main entry point for batch operations. It runs up to

    The execution pipeline for each record is the full service.py pipeline,
    so every record gets: cache check → rate limit → retry → normalize → cache store.

    Args:
        db: Database session for key resolution and billing.
        operation: The operation to run (e.g. "enrich_person").
        provider_name: Provider to use. None = use default for the operation.
        records: List of param dicts, one per record.
                 e.g. [{"email": "a@b.com"}, {"email": "c@d.com"}]
        tenant_id: The tenant making the request.
        concurrency: Max simultaneous API calls. Recommended:
                     - Apollo: 5 (rate limit ~10 req/s burst)
                     - RocketReach: 3 (global 10 req/s across all endpoints)
                     - PredictLeads: 5 (plan-dependent)
        checkpoint_every: Fire on_checkpoint callback after this many records.
        timeout_seconds: Global timeout for the entire batch (default 5 min).
        on_checkpoint: Optional async callback for progress reporting.

    Returns:
