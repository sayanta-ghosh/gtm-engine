## Provider Deep-Dive: Strengths & Weaknesses

### Apollo (provider: `apollo`)
**Best for:** General people search, company enrichment, title/company filtering
**Strengths:**
- Largest B2B database (270M+ contacts)
- Rich company profiles (tech stack, funding, employee count)
- Best title + company + location filtering
- Bulk enrichment (up to 10 per call)
**Weaknesses:**
- School/education filter (`person_education_school_names`) is UNRELIABLE — returns generic results
- `q_keywords` free-text search is too broad for specific filtering
- `organization_past_domains` (past company search) returns poor results
- People search returns obfuscated data — needs separate enrichment for emails

### RocketReach (provider: `rocketreach`)
**Best for:** Alumni searches, phone numbers, school-based filtering
**Strengths:**
- `school` filter WORKS RELIABLY for university/education searches
- `previous_employer` filter WORKS for finding company alumni
- Higher phone number coverage than Apollo
- Email grading (A/A- grades are verified)
**Weaknesses:**
- Smaller overall database than Apollo
- No bulk enrichment in one call
- Company enrichment is less detailed than Apollo
- Async lookups: some requests return `status: "in_progress"` and need polling

**IMPORTANT for school searches:**
- Always pass BOTH variants of the school name:
  ```json
  {"school": ["IIT Kharagpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"]}
  ```
- Same for any school: `["MIT", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"]`
- RocketReach matches on the school name as stored in LinkedIn profiles

### PredictLeads (provider: `predictleads`)
**Best for:** Company signals — jobs, tech, news, financing, similar companies
**Strengths:**
- Real-time company signal data (jobs refresh every 36 hours)
- Structured, categorized events (not raw text)
- Similar companies uses ML scoring
- Financing data includes investors and round types
**Weaknesses:**
- Company-only (no people data)
- Requires dual-key auth (token + key)
- Coverage varies: strong for US/EU companies, weaker for emerging markets

### RapidAPI Google (provider: `rapidapi_google`)
**Best for:** Google search results for research, news monitoring, competitive intel
**Strengths:**
- Real-time Google SERP results via RapidAPI (OpenWeb Ninja)
- Up to 300 results per query (no pagination needed)
- Google operators work in query: site:, filetype:, inurl:, intitle:, -keyword
- Time filters (qdr:h/d/w/m/y) for recent results
- Bulk search with concurrent execution
**Weaknesses:**
- Single endpoint (web search only — news/images/maps are separate RapidAPI products)
- Failed requests still consume quota
- It's Google search — results are broad, not structured B2B data
- Need to craft good queries for useful results

**Rate limits:** 10-30 req/sec depending on tier ($25-$150/mo)
**Adaptive throttling:** Response headers x-ratelimit-remaining, x-ratelimit-reset

**Query patterns that work well:**
- Funding: `"{company}" "raised" OR "series" OR "funding"`
- Hiring: `site:linkedin.com/jobs "{company}"`
- Tech stack: `"{company}" "powered by" OR "built with" OR "uses"`
- Leadership: `"{company}" "appointed" OR "new hire" OR "joins as"`
- LinkedIn: `site:linkedin.com/in "{name}" "{company}"`

### BetterContact (provider: `bettercontact`)
**Best for:** Maximum email/phone coverage via waterfall enrichment (20+ providers)
**Strengths:**

- Only charges for found + verified data (no credits for misses)
- 87-95% email coverage vs 60-70% from a single provider
- Built-in email verification (Bouncer) and catch-all validation
- Phone number coverage 70-85% (vs ~40% from single providers)
**Weaknesses:**
- Async API — must poll for results or use webhooks (adds latency)

- Cannot specify which underlying provider to use
- No company-only enrichment (people data only)
- Batch limit: 100 per request

- Domain Search finds ALL known emails at a company (up to 100)
- Email Finder generates likely email from name+domain with confidence score
- Email Verifier checks deliverability with specific status codes

- Sources tracking shows WHERE emails were found
**Weaknesses:**
- No phone numbers at all
- No people search by title/seniority (different tool category than Apollo)
- Free tier extremely limited (25 searches/month)
- Email Finder is pattern-based guessing, not verified contacts
- Confidence scores below 70 are unreliable

### ZeroBounce (provider: `zerobounce`)
**Best for:** Email validation before campaigns — deliverability verification with detailed status codes
**Strengths:**
- 99.6% validation accuracy with detailed status + sub_status
- Catch-all detection distinguishes accept_all (safer) vs catch-all (risky)
- Disposable, spam trap, and toxic email detection

- Lead management with campaign assignment and movement
- A/B testing and sequence building
- 6,000 req/min rate limit (generous)
**Weaknesses:**
- API access requires Hypergrowth plan ($97/mo) or above — Growth plan has NO API
- V2 only — V1 is deprecated and incompatible
- Lead listing uses POST (not GET) — non-standard REST
- Sequences array quirk: only first element is used despite being an array
- Warmup must run 30+ days before campaign launch
- Hard caps on monthly emails (no overage billing, just pauses sending)

### Parallel Web (provider: `parallel_web`)
**Best for:** Web scraping, content extraction, AI-powered web research at scale
**Strengths:**
- AI-native API by Parallel (parallel.ai) — purpose-built for agents

### 1. ICP List Building
```
Apollo search_people (title + company size + industry)
  → Apollo enrich_person (get emails for top matches)
  → PredictLeads company_jobs (verify they're hiring = budget available)
```

### 2. Alumni Network Mining

## Auto-Selection Rules

The CLI and execution engine follow these rules:

1. **If `--school` or `--past-company` flag is used** → auto-select RocketReach
2. **If operation starts with `company_`** → auto-select PredictLeads
3. **If operation is `search_web`** → auto-select RapidAPI Google
4. **If operation is `scrape_page`, `crawl_site`, `extract_structured`, `batch_extract`** → auto-select Parallel Web
5. **If operation is `validate_email` or `batch_validate`** → auto-select ZeroBounce
6. **If operation is `domain_search` or `email_finder`** → auto-select Hunter
7. **If operation is `create_campaign`, `manage_leads`, or `campaign_analytics`** → auto-select Instantly
8. **If `--waterfall` flag is used or max coverage is requested** → auto-select BetterContact for enrichment
9. **Everything else (enrich, search people/companies)** → default to Apollo
10. **User can always override** with `--provider` flag

Note: Parallel Web also supports `search_web` (AI-powered objective search).
Use `--provider parallel_web` to get Parallel's agentic search instead of Google.
