## Campaign Workflow
1. Create campaign with name and schedule
2. Add verified leads (always verify first!)
3. Set sequences/steps in Instantly UI or via API
4. Monitor analytics via /analytics/campaign/summary

## Important: Always verify emails before adding to Instantly
Sending to invalid emails damages sender reputation.
